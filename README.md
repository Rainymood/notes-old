# Notes

This repo contains notes that I collect and maintain. 

I've long wanted a repository like Chris Albon's but never got around to figuring it out how it works.

That's why I want to build it out here, in the open, with copious notes. It took me a long time to get started and hopefully finish this one day so I want to provide as much documentation as possible so I clear the path ahead for others wanting to do the same. 

Code is GPL licensed so do whatever you want with it, a head nod or attribution would be nice :)

## Build notes
### 23-01-2020

* To run simply run `hugo server`  
* Structure of the notes is hardcoded in `themes/berbera/layouts/index.html`
    * This is something I want to automate and make modular with Python
* I think I want to remove the navigation bar because I don't need it
* "Layout" of the main page can be found in `themes/berbera/layouts/_default/baseof.html`
* Removed the navbar
