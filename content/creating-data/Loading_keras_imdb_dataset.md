# Loading Keras IMDB dataset

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

from keras.datasets import imdb
from keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
```

This downloads 25.000 movie reviews from IMDB with the label positive/negative.

Each review is encoded as a list of indexes (integers)

Words are encoded by overall frequency in the dataset. Integer 3 encodes the 3rd most frequent word in the data. 

## Create data

```python
# set number of features (use top 1000 words)
num_words = 1000
index_from = 3

# load data
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = imdb.load_data(num_words=num_words, index_from=index_from)
```

## Convert word to index (and reverse)

Note that by default indexing starts from 3 in the default settings as follows.

```
start_char=1, oov_char=2, index_from=3,
```

This means that: 

* `0` is the padding char
* `1` is the start char
* `2` is oov
* `3` is unknown

So we need to load in the mapping and then shift it 3 to the right, very convenient.

```python
# Get word index (word => index)
word_to_id = imdb.get_word_index()
word_to_id = {k:(v+index_from) for k,v in word_to_id.items()}
word_to_id["<PAD>"] = 0
word_to_id["<START>"] = 1
word_to_id["<UNK>"] = 2
word_to_id["<UNUSED>"] = 3

# Reverse word index (index => word)
id_to_word = dict([(value, key) for (key, value) in word_to_id.items()])
```

## View data

```python
" ".join([id_to_word[i] for i in x_train[1000]])
```

## Tokenize

```python
# Convert list of integers to one-hot matrix
tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=num_words)
```

```python
# Convert list of integers into matrix with max length of dict
train_features = tokenizer.sequences_to_matrix(x_train, mode='binary')
test_features = tokenizer.sequences_to_matrix(x_test, mode='binary')

print(f"train features shape: {train_features.shape}, test features shape {test_features.shape}") 
```

    train features shape: (25000, 1000), test features shape (25000, 1000)

Now you have: 

* `(25000, 1000)` train features ohe matrix
* `(25000, 1000)` test features ohe matrix 
* `(25000,)` train labels
* `(25000,)` test labels
